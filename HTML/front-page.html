            Price increases remained uncomfortably rapid in August as a <br> broad array of goods and services became more expensive even as <br> gas prices fell, evidence that the sustainable inflation slowdown the <br> Federal Reserve and White House have been hoping for remains <br> elusive. <br><br>
            Prices rose 8.3 percent from a year earlier, a fresh Consumer Price <br> Index report released on Tuesday showed. While slightly better <br> than July’s 8.5 percent, the rate was not as much of a moderation <br> as economists had expected as rent costs, restaurant meals and <br> medical care became more expensive. Compounding the bad news, <br> a core measure of inflation that strips out gas and food to get a <br> sense of underlying price trends accelerated more than forecast. <br><br>
            Stocks plummeted on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 falling 4.3 percent <br> — its biggest drop since the depths of the pandemic in 2020 — as <br> the data appeared to cement the case for another unusually large <br> interest rate increase of three-quarters of a percentage point at the <br> Fed’s meeting next week. That would be the third consecutive <br> move of that size and bring rates to a range of 3 to 3.25 percent. <br> Investors speculated that officials could even opt for a more drastic <br> adjustment of a full percentage point this month or extend their <br> campaign of swift rate moves for longer. <br><br>
            Fed officials have been raising interest rates since March to slow <br> the economy in a bid to tame America’s worst bout of inflation in <br> four decades, but the data suggested that their efforts were not yet <br> having much of an effect. Inflation’s relentlessness may force <br> central bankers to clamp down on the economy harder, potentially <br> pushing up unemployment more starkly, as they try to wrestle <br> prices back under control. <br><br>
            “Inflation momentum accelerated in all the wrong places,” said <br> Blerina Uruci, a U.S. economist at T. Rowe Price, explaining that <br> strong household balance sheets may be helping to sustain demand <br> even as interest rates rise and borrowing becomes expensive. <br><br>
            “In this environment, monetary policy has to do that much more to <br> cool down demand and have an effect on prices,” Ms. Uruci said. <br><br>
